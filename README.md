# RemoteRPC
Discord RPC Bridge I originally made for FlareVM but should just work on anything

Pretty Self explanatory this one, run vm on the remote machine, run host on the client with discord on it
I run this with no network connection in the FlareVM also, so this is really good if you have an airgap network and do RE work and you wanna share your RPC status from apps in the vm without compromising your discord token
